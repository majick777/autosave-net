Auto-saves on steroids! QuickSave Timed Backup of your Post Content while writing. Compare and Restore QuickSave backups metabox.

== Description ==

AutoSave Net was built to catch your content from being lost as you are writing or saving it. Sometimes you get a disconnect or timeout on clicking Save or Update... or you get the dreaded "Are you sure you want to do this screen?" and lose your work... No more! Simply install the plugin and it will be there for you - when you really need it!

AutoSave Net adds a timed QuickSave Backup via AJAX for just your post content (not metadata) that saves your work regularly, and let's your easily compare your saved content with the Pageload or Autosave content using the inbuilt WordPress visual difference function. This means you can quickly and easily see your latest content and restore it without hassles. Why lose or rewrite any more sentences?

You can also control if when and how often the QuickSave Backup is done on a post by post basis via the post metabox, or adjust which post types you want to the QuickSave Backup to run for on the Admin screen.

The QuickSave Backup works independently and side-by-side the inbuilt WordPress AutoSave, but the AutoSave Net plugin also allows you to modify the inbuilt WordPress AutoSave Options:

* Limit Number of Post Revisions stored for each post
* Change the WordPress AutoSave backup interval
* Disable WordPress AutoSave entirely if you like
